# Inspiration

Dietary Scanner - Byte of 87 was inspired by the need for a comprehensive tool that simplifies dietary choices, combining information on halal, vegan, and vegetarian suitability with allergen details.

# What it does

The app scans product barcodes to determine if they align with halal, vegan, or vegetarian diets. It also provides insights into potential allergens, offering users a holistic view of their food choices.

# How we built it

Built using advanced barcode scanning technology and a robust database, Dietary Scanner - Byte of 87 was meticulously crafted to deliver accurate and real-time information to users.

# Challenges we ran into

Initially, we intended to create a web app that would allow users to access the program from any device. We ran into significant issues with getting a live stream of the user's webcam to the server. Due to this, we pivoted to a desktop application to minimize time loss so that we were able to develop a working prototype. We can take what we learned developing this prototype and apply it to a variety of different platforms in the future.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud to have developed a user-friendly app that empowers individuals to make informed dietary decisions effortlessly, fostering a healthier and more mindful approach to food consumption.

# What we learned

The development process enriched our comprehension of app development, API utilization, and fostered valuable teamwork skills.

# What's next for Dietary Scanner - Byte of 87

We aim to transform this into a mobile app, leveraging superior phone camera resolution for accurate barcode decoding. We'll implement an improved barcode decoding algorithm and integrate robust databases. Our plan includes adding dietary options such as kosher, keto, and pescatarian. The future involves refining, expanding, and forming partnerships to make Dietary Scanner - Byte of 87 an essential tool for dietary transparency and informed choices.
